## Hello there, my name is Chuks Chiazor 

Professional data scientist, researcher, nature enthusiast, and lifelong learner. 
I am fascinated by the transformative power of technology in shaping how we live.

With an M.Sc. in Business Intelligence and Analytics from The University of Huddersfield, I have over five years of experience in 
harnessing data-driven methodologies, statistical modeling, and machine learning. My journey in the field has been focused on driving business growth, 
enhancing customer experiences, and optimizing profitability. I specialize in developing customer behavioral algorithms, leveraging visualization tools, 
and managing comprehensive research projects. These skills have been instrumental in my track record of successfully transforming data infrastructures, 
deriving critical insights, and formulating actionable recommendations.

Being a lifelong learner, I thrive in collaborative environments and excel in communicating complex data insights in a clear, impactful manner. 
I am deeply passionate about using data to inform strategic decision-making. I'm always eager to take on new data science challenges or explore fresh ideas. 
If you're interested in collaboration, whether it's tackling a new data science problem or brainstorming innovative concepts, 
I'd love to connect and see how we can create something amazing together.

## Projects


### Deciphering Amazon's User-based Recommendation System
[Project's Github with more details](https://github.com/chukolate007/Predicting-GPA-Scores-of-College-Students)

This project offers a step-by-step guide to creating a movie recommender system using Amazon’s movie ratings dataset. By the end of this guide, you’ll gain not just technical know-how but also insights into the practical applications of such models, particularly in shaping personalized educational tools, a blend of data science and educational innovation. Surprise library (SVD Algorithm) was utilized as the recommender system.
(Completed in October 2023).

### Student Success Prediction with GPA Scores
[Project's Github with more details](https://github.com/chukolate007/Predicting-GPA-Scores-of-College-Students)

For educators, it's sad to see students struggle and drop out. The goal of this analytics project was to predict the GPA scores of college students based on their SAT scores and attendance. A regression model was used, as well as stats models library in Python. The findings from the project can be used by educators to identify poor-performing students at risk of dropping out on time and provide targeted support and personalized learning.
(First Completed April 2020. Updated July, 2023).

### Leveraging Analytical Tools for Barratt Development PLC's Strategic Investment Decision
[Project's Github with more details](https://github.com/chukolate007/Analytical-Report-of-Barratt-Development-PLC-)

This report aims to provide sufficient advice on Barratt as a good company for investment based on existing data and to provide prospective investors with an understanding of the company's overall financial performance. To accomplish this, descriptive, time series, and fundamental analysis were carried.

From the analysis, Barratt has a higher mean return and standard deviation. This however implies that Barratt has both the higher return and volatility/risk. The regression line had a good fit between Barratt and Berkeley Returns. The time series forecasting analysis suggests Simple Exponential Smoothing method as the most suitable forecasting model due to its lower Moving Average Error and highest (four) forecast line points matching with the test price line (ground truth or expectation).
(Completed in April 2022)


### Exploring the immigration to Canada
